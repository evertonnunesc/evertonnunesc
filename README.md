# Hey

Welcome to my page!
My name is Everton Nunes, I'm from Brazil :house:. I'm passionate about solving problems and learning. Always open to new challengs and ready to face changes.

I am also an open-source enthusiast and maintainer. I learned a lot from the open-source community and I love how collaboration and knowledge sharing happened through open-source.
